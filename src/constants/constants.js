    "I collaborated with my team to test flagship devices, identify and resolve critical issues, and manage the lab IT network. " +
    "Additionally, I enhanced team capabilities by operating and maintaining lab equipment and training colleagues in 3D printing and CAD " +
    "design. My role required a blend of technical expertise and proactive problem-solving, ensuring the reliability and performance of our " +
    "cutting-edge technology.",

     "appealing and user-friendly interface. Starting with little to no prior knowledge of JavaScript or website creation, I embarked on this personal project, " +
     "teaching myself the fundamentals along the way. It's been a journey of growth and accomplishment, and I'm proud to present this site as a testament " +
     "to my dedication and newfound skills!",

    "and once 8/10 questions are answered correctly, candy is dispensed through an internal mechanism. The hardware for this project was designed in "+
    "SolidWorks and AutoCAD, incorporating lasercut wood and 3D printed parts, along with servo motors. The electronic component was " +
    "coded in Python, utilizing a RaspberryPi. ",
